The owl who used to come to the class in the morning and used to give a short peek at the class somehow caught my attention. I wanted to become your friend. But, the Mohaiminul inside me didn't allow Tasin to do so. However, after 4.5 long years, your cat , 'Ryu', who adopted you obviously helped me gather the courage and finally text you something other than 'Happy Birthday or Eid Mubarak'. Well, I hope we are friends by now, but even if we are not, at least now you know I exist :3. Happy Birthday once again. ",
